		description: [
			`It has been quite the ride to where I am today. At the start of high school in 2014, I learned how to create a big, red square that when clicked, would send you to Google. CRAZY, I know!! I was amazed that I was able to build something, no matter how small and silly, by writing a few lines of HTML and Javascript. From that point on, I've been constantly tinkering and building small projects.`,
			`After high school, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Ohio State in 2018, but was very quickly met with many challenges and struggled in the early parts of my college career.`,
			`However, after some re-adjustment and a LOT of hard work and summer classes, I was able to get back on track and will graduate in Spring of 2022 with a degree in Information Systems and a minor in Entrepreneurship & Innovation. I was also fortunate enough to work at a few different internships throughout college. Check out what I've done on my experience page!`,
			`I am currently working at my most recent internship with Ubihere building web dashboards using React, Django, and some other technologies. We are a very small startup, so I have been personally responsible for the entire development of the dashboard. This has been quite a challenge, but I've been able to learn so much in a rather short period of time.`,
			`In addition to learning at work, I spend a lot of my own time now learning by completing online courses, reading articles/documentation and completing tutorials. I absolutely love learning new things and I find myself to be curious about almost anything. I recently took a long car trip through rural parts of Ohio and Virginia and became fascinated by how electricity gets from power plants to houses and buildings, and also how farms use grain bins to store the grain they produce on their farms! All super weird, niche stuff, and not related to my line of work, but extremely fascinating in my opinion! So like I said, I'd consider myself a very curious person!`,
