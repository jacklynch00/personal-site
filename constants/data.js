		description: [
			`It has been quite the ride to where I am today. In the beginning of high school in 2014, I learned how to create a big red square that when clicked, would send you to Google. CRAZY, I know!! From then on, I've been constantly tinkering and building smaller projects.`,
			`After high school I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Ohio State in 2018, but was very quickly met with many challenges and struggled in the early parts of my college career.`,
			`However, after some re-adjustment and a LOT of hard work and summer classes, I was able to get back on track and will graduate in Spring of 2022 with a degree in Information Systems and a minor in Entrepreneurship & Innovation. I was also fortunate enough to work at a few different internships throughout college. Check out some of my experiences on my experience page!`,
			`I am currently working at my most recent internship with Ubihere building web dashboards using React, Django, and other technologies. We are a small startup so I have been personally responsible for the entire development of the dashboard which has been quite the learning task, but I have been able to learn so much. In addition to learning at work, I spend a lot of my own time now learning by completing online courses, reading articles/documentation and completing tutorials.`,
